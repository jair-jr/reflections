When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    When I need to share my work with other students or to simply have a backup of local repository in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Because git has no way to know when is the right time to pull changes from the remote repository. For example, I might be working on a feature and only want the local codebase do change after I am finished.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A "fork" command is a GitHub concept. It copies a repository from one user to another. It is useful when you want to change someone's repository but don't have the appropriate rights.

    A "clone" command copies a repository from one location to another, remote or local. It is useful if you want to change a one repository and keep the other one in sync.

    A "branch" command creates a new area to which we can add new commits in parallel to other commit areas. It is useful if you want to experiment new code without changing your current codebase.
